## Snake Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game, written in JavaScript. It can be played in the browser by visiting: <a href="https://github.com/rafiferdos/snake-game">https://github.com/rafiferdos/snake-game</a>.

### How to play

Use the arrow keys to control the snake's direction. The goal is to eat the apple without hitting the walls or yourself. Each time you eat an apple, the snake will grow longer and the game will become more difficult.

### Controls

* `Arrow up`: Move the snake up
* `Arrow down`: Move the snake down
* `Arrow left`: Move the snake left
* `Arrow right`: Move the snake right

### Game over

The game is over if the snake hits the walls or itself.

### Tips

* Try to stay in the center of the board to give yourself more room to maneuver.
* Don't be afraid to eat your own tail if you're in a bind.
* Be patient and don't get greedy.
